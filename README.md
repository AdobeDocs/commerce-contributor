# Commerce Contributor

This repository is used to store the code for the Commerce Contributor documentation website. It is built using the [Adobe Edge Delivery Services](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/edge-delivery/overview) and deployed to [Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/contributor/).

## Quick Start

For local development, you need to start three servers:

1. **Content server** (your content repo):

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. **Code server** ([adp-devsite](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite
cd adp-devsite
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. **Runtime connector** ([devsite-runtime-connector](https://github.com/aemsites/devsite-runtime-connector)):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aemsites/devsite-runtime-connector
cd devsite-runtime-connector
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once all three servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/<pathPrefix>`

For common utilities and documentation, please see the [centralized README](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/adp-devsite-utils/blob/main/README.md).
